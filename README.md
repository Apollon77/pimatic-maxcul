pimatic-maxcul
=======================

Pimatic plugin to control MAX! home heating devices with a Busware CUL868 usb wireless stick.

v0.1.0 :
This first Version enables the user to receive messages from the MAX! devices. It receives the
messages, decodes them and prints them to the console or log as debuging information.

v0.2.0 :
This version enables you to pare the max shutter contacts with the pimatic system and use them as
sensor. Also you can pair the heating thermostats so that they can get the time informations from the
pimatic system an set the mode (auto/boost/manuel) and switch between the comfy and eco temperature.

At the moment the software is at a development stage so please use it with caution.

More informations and function will be coming soon.

WORK IN PROGRESS
