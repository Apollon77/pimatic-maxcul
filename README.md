Usage

The maxcul Plugin automatically detects incoming pairing messages and reacts accordingly.
If you start pimatic with the plugin enable you can enable the debug mode in the settings to get the deviceIds extracted from the incomming pairing messages.

Changelog
---------------

* v0.1.0

    This first Version enables the user to receive messages from the MAX! devices. It receives the
messages, decodes them and prints them to the console or log as debuging information.

* v0.2.0

    This version enables you to pare the max shutter contacts with the pimatic system and use them as
sensor. Also you can pair the heating thermostats so that they can get the time informations from the
pimatic system an set the mode (auto/boost/manuel) and switch between the comfy and eco temperature.

* v0.2.5

    This Version enables the user to use the thermostat heating elements. You can now set the desired temperature, the mode, show the battery state and the measured temperature in the pimatic frontend

-------
* CUL Credit System support to respect the ISM Band 1% Rules
* Add group support to handle groups of devices as one
* Monitoring Mode to receive only the messages without responding
* Support for programming Week Profile (at the moment there is only the default program in "Auto Mode")
